# Image-Detection

## Purpose of the appplication
In this repository, you can find a small project I did during my Master degree. In this application, I use interest points to compare features descriptors from the webcam with the ones from a still image (image 1). If image 1 is placed in the webcam field, the application will detect it and replace it with Image 2.

## How to use
```
 .\bin\ImageDetection.exe -i .\exemples\image1.jpg -i .\exemples\image2.jpg
```
